\title{return igraph object from simule result specified by user input}
\usage{
returngraph(x, type = "task", neighbouroption = "task", subID = NULL,
  index = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{output generated from simule/wsimule function (simule/wsimule class)}

\item{type}{type of graph, there are four options:
(1) "task" (graph for each task (including shared part) specified further by subID (task number))
(2) "share" (shared graph for all tasks)
(3) "taskspecific" (graph for each task specific (excluding shared part)
specified further by subID (task number) )
(4) "neighbour" (zoom into nodes in the graph specified further by neighbouroptoin, subID (task number)
and index (node id))}

\item{neighbouroption}{determines what type of graph to zoom into when parameter type is "neighbour"
There are two options:
(1) "task" (zoom into graph for each task (including shared part))
(2) "taskspecific" (zoom into graph for each task specific (excluding shared part))}

\item{subID}{selects which task to display
(1) 0 (only allowed when type is task or type is neighbour and neighbouroption is task) (selecting share graph)
(2) positive task number (selects a task number)
(3) a vector of task number (selects multiple tasks)
(4) NULL (selects all tasks (all graphs))}

\item{index}{determines which node(s) to zoom into when parameter type is "neighbour"
could either be an integer or vector of integers representing node ids
(zoom into one node or multiple nodes)}
}
\value{
an igraph object of graph / subgraph from simule result specified by user input
}
\description{
This function can return an igraph object from simule result for user to work with directly
}
\details{
the function aims to provide users the flexibility to explore and visualize the graph own their own
generated from simule / wsimule
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
data(exampleData)
result = simule(X = exampleData , lambda = 0.1, epsilon = 0.45, covType = "cov", TRUE)
graph = returngraph(result, type="task")
}
