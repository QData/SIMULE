\title{A constrained and weighted l1 minimization approach for estimating multiple
Sparse Gaussian or Nonparanormal Graphical Models}
\usage{
wsimule(X, lambda, epsilon = 1, W, covType = "cov", parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A List of input matrices. They can be data matrices or
covariance/correlation matrices. If every matrix in the X is a symmetric
matrix, the matrices are assumed to be covariance/correlation matrices. More
details at <https://github.com/QData/SIMULE>}

\item{lambda}{A positive number. The hyperparameter controls the sparsity
level of the matrices. The \eqn{\lambda_n} in the following section:
Details.}

\item{epsilon}{A positive number. The hyperparameter controls the
differences between the shared pattern among graphs and the individual part
of each graph. The \eqn{\epsilon} in the following section: Details. If
epsilon becomes larger, the generated graphs will be more similar to each
other. The default value is 1, which means that we set the same weights to
the shared pattern among graphs and the individual part of each graph.}

\item{W}{A weight matrix. This matrix uses the prior knowledge of the
graphs. For example, if we use wsimule to infer multiple human brain
connectome graphs, the \eqn{W} can be the anatomical distance matrix of
human brain. The default value is a matrix, whose entries all equals to 1.
This means that we do not have any prior knowledge.}

\item{covType}{A parameter to decide which Graphical model we choose to
estimate from the input data.

If covType = "cov", it means that we estimate multiple sparse Gaussian
Graphical models. This option assumes that we calculate (when input X
represents data directly) or use (when X elements are symmetric representing
covariance matrices) the sample covariance matrices as input to the simule
algorithm.

If covType = "kendall", it means that we estimate multiple nonparanormal
Graphical models. This option assumes that we calculate (when input X
represents data directly) or use (when X elements are symmetric representing
correlation matrices) the kendall's tau correlation matrices as input to the
simule algorithm.}

\item{parallel}{A boolean. This parameter decides if the package will use
the multithreading architecture or not.}
}
\value{
\item{Graphs}{A list of the estimated inverse covariance/correlation
matrices.} \item{share}{The share graph among multiple tasks.}

\details{
The SIMULE algorithm is a constrained l1 minimization method that can detect
both the shared and the task-specific parts of multiple graphs explicitly
from data (through jointly estimating multiple sparse Gaussian graphical
models or Nonparanormal graphical models). It solves the following equation:
\deqn{ \hat{\Omega}^{(1)}_I, \hat{\Omega}^{(2)}_I, \dots,
\hat{\Omega}^{(K)}_I, \hat{\Omega}_S =
\min\limits_{\Omega^{(i)}_I,\Omega_S}\sum\limits_i ||W \cdot
\Omega^{(i)}_I||_1+ \epsilon K||W \cdot \Omega_S||_1 } Subject to : \deqn{
||\Sigma^{(i)}(\Omega^{(i)}_I + \Omega_S) - I||_{\infty} \le \lambda_{n}, i
= 1,\dots,K \nonumber } Please also see the equation (7) in our paper. The
\eqn{\lambda_n} is the hyperparameter controlling the sparsity level of the
matrices and it is the \code{lambda} in our function. The \eqn{\epsilon} is
the hyperparameter controlling the differences between the shared pattern
among graphs and the individual part of each graph. It is the \code{epsilon}
parameter in our function and the default value is 1. For further details,
please see our paper:
